## MicroWiki Foundation

MicroWiki is the largest online encyclop√¶dia about micronations, small and often rather eccentric nations that are unrecognised by the wider international community. The wiki is being continually improved and updated by hundreds of active editors, with content being moderated by a small group of staff and funded by our generous Patrons. MicroWiki runs on MediaWiki, a powerful Wiki tool created by the Wikimedia Foundation and the community.

### Open source

MicroWiki Foundation, much like the Wikimedia Foundation, is committed to open source. We will share all of our projects here on Github. Most of these tools are tailor-made for our Wiki and will not receive any support from our side for any third party usages.

Most of our software is distributed under the MIT license.
